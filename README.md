# SimpleDRO
DRO-like readout of digital caliper or digital dial indicator using Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino IDE

If you do not have a digital readout (DRO) on your lathe, drill press or millig machine, you can use this little helper to get precise readings with DRO-like functions for one axis. You can even use one of these devices per axis and you have a very basic DRO!

### Features
- Show readout on a display
- Switch between linear and diameter mode (useful for turning)
- Invert reading direction
- Set Zero or enter reference value

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Waveshare Pico Restouch 3.5" touch display module: https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-3.5.htm
- Cheap Chinese digital caliper or digital dial indicator with data port. 
- Case (used Hammond Electronics 1590SBK, this comes already with black coating)
- USB power supply or power bank

### Software
You can either compile and upload the sketch using the Arduino IDE or you can simply upload the compiled UF2 file
#### Upload UF2 file
- Install Raspberry Pi Pico on the Pico ResTouch module and connect Pico to a USB port.
- Press "Bootsel" button on the Pico and "Run" button on the ResTouch simultaneously. A new drive "RPI-RP2" appears.
- Copy the uf2-file SimpleDRO.ino.uf2 to this drive (or SimpleDRO.ino_fine_res.uf2 for 3 digit resolution). Pico will reboot and run the program. 
- Touch the corners as indicated to calibrate touch screen. This should only be necessary on first startup with a new Pico. The calibration values are saved in flash memory.

#### Compilation and Upload
- Install Arduino IDE (www.arduino.cc)
- Configure Arduino IDE as described in https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-ResTouch-LCD-3.5
  - install Raspberry Pi Pico Board driver by Earle F. Philhower III (https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)
  - install TFT_eSPI library and configure it as described in the Waveshare Wiki Page mentionned above
- Open the SimpleDRO.ino
- Set flash memory:

- compile and upload.
  
### Electronics
Many of the cheap Chinese calipers offer 4 connections for data readout. (Unfortunately, there is no list of calipers that use the protocol described below nor is there any indication when ordering. Many do use this protocol, but there are also others. You probably have to try first with one that is lying around in your workshop or you just order one and try.)
Measured values are periodically sent (e.g. every 100 ms), even if the caliper is in the OFF-state. Most cheap calipers use a simple protocol with 24 bits (bit 0 to bit 23). The first few bits contain the numeric value in a binary coding, bit 20 contains the sign (+ or -), bit 23 contains the unit (inch or mm). The state of the data signal at each falling edge of the clock signal indicates the state of the individual bits. Here is an example of the readings "0.00" and "0.08":

The calipers works with 1.5 V so that the clock and data signals have to be amplified in order to be used as inputs for the Pico. This is done using two transistors:

If you connect the "Vpos" pin as shown in the schematics above, you can power the caliper and do not need a battery anymore. 

### Instructions
Here is the screenshot of the GUI:

#### Zero the display
Press "SET" button twice.
#### Enter reference value
Press "SET" button, enter the reference value and press "SET" button again.
#### Use diameter mode
When used on the X axis of a lathe, the diameter is more important than the linear reading. The change in diameter is calculated by dividing the change in linear displacement by 2. Simply press the "DIA" button and the diameter symbol Ã˜ will appear in the screen. The diameter mode ist enabled by default on startup. This helps preventing scrap on the lathe, if you forget to switch on diameter mode...
#### Invert reading
If the direction of your measurement is opposite to the direction of the caliper or dial indicator, press the "INV" button. The "INV" button will turn grey. The displayed values will decrease when the caliper opens or the dial indicator pin is pushed in. To switch off inverted reading, press the "INV" button again.



Here is a version using a caliper...

...and a version using a digital dial indicator with 3 digits resolution (this requires compiling the INO file with FINE_RESOLUTION set to true or using the already compiled file SimpleDRO.ino_fine_res.uf2) :
